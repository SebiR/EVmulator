# EVmulator
A small PCB to go into IEC 62196 Typ 2 EV charging plugs to emulate a car to use a charging station as a normal outlet.

It's currently running with an ATTiny85, although an ATTiny25 will suffice. In the future it might be done with an ATTiny10.

## Features
* Two LEDs as status indicator
* Automatic switch from connected to charging
* 13 or 32A selectable current
* EVSE Pilot monitoring
* Completely powered by the pilot signal

## Function

The EVmulator simulates a connected car for the EVSE (electric vehicle supply equipment, the wallbox)

The EVSE outputs a 1kHz square wave signal with Â±12V referenced to PE with 1000 ohms impedance on the CP (Control Pilot) pin and measures the voltage of the CP line.
As the EVmulator has a 1300 ohms resitor to PE, the positive voltage of the CP line is pulled to 9V and the EVSE detects a connected car.

After connecting, the EVmulator will detect the 1kHz PWM signal on the CP line and after approx. 5 seconds of PWM, the second restitor with 4.7kohms will be connected in parallel to the first resitor. As the voltage on the CP line drops to 6V, the EVSE will recognize the emulator as a charging car.

## Usage

## Firmware
### Just flash the HEX
Flash the provided hex file with avrdude or AVRDUDESS:

When burning the fuses, make sure to set the ISP clock speed very low, as the ATtiny will run with 128kHz clock. 10kHz works fine.
Lo: 0xC4
Hi: 0xD7

### Compiling with Arduino
The project utilises the ATTinyCore from Spence Konde: https://github.com/SpenceKonde/ATTinyCore

As the Arduino IDE only changes the CKSEL fuse bits when burning the bootloader, you still have to set the fuses with avrdude!
Burning the bootloader to set the fuses before flasdhing the firmware won't work, as the default ISP clock speed will be too high for the 128kHz clock of the controller.
